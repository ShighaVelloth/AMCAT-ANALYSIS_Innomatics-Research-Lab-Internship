## AMCAT ANALYSIS

This project involves the analysis of a dataset containing student and job-related information, including demographics, education details, salary, job roles, and personality traits. 
The main aim of the analysis is to explore relationships between various factors like salary, specialization, and gender, as well as assess the impact of personality traits on salary outcomes.
Here performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and applied statistical testing to validate claims and assumptions about salary distribution and role-specific averages.

## Dataset Description

The dataset was released by Aspiring Minds from the Aspiring Mind Employment Outcome 2015 (AMEO). The study is primarily limited only to students with engineering disciplines.
The dataset contains the employment outcomes of engineering graduates as dependent variables (Salary, Job Titles, and Job Locations) along with the standardized scores 
from three different areas â€“ cognitive skills, technical skills and personality skills.The dataset also contains demographic features. 
The dataset contains around 40 independent variables and 4000 data points. The independent variables are both continuous and categorical in nature.
